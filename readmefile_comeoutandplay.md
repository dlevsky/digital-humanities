# ReadMe File

We have created an interactive map hosted on a [static website](https://chiqueerperformace.wixsite.com/comeoutandplay) that highlights locations in Chicago that consider themselves LGBTQ+ entertainment spaces, or spaces that put on LGBTQ+ programming regularly. Each layer of the map represents a different area of Chicago, and each icon represents a specific type of performance space, along with each individual space's current and historical information attached to it.

Further descriptions of the project and information needed to add locations to the [Come Out and Play map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1DlwSGazaPThU94O5Ao0kNAGo9iiakdrC&hl=en) are located on the [“About” page](https://chiqueerperformace.wixsite.com/comeoutandplay/about) of the [static website](https://chiqueerperformace.wixsite.com/comeoutandplay). 

The project email is linked to both the static site and Google My Maps. Questions from the [“Contact” page](https://chiqueerperformace.wixsite.com/comeoutandplay/contact) on the static sent are sent to the project email.
