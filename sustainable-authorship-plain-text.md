# Section 1: An Introduction to Markdown

## Subsection 1.1: Principles of Markdown

In class, I spent the first half of our lab learning about Markdown. In particular, the main point in The Programming Historian's [Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown#using-pandoc-to-convert-markdown-to-an-ms-word-document) seemed to be:

> This is where Markdown shines. Markdown is a syntax for marking semantic elements within a document explicitly, not in some hidden layer. The idea is to identify units that are meaningful to humans, like titles, sections, subsections, footnotes, and illustrations. At the very least, your files will always remain comprehensible to you, even if the editor you are currently using stops working or “goes out of business.”

The principles of Markdown include:
* Sustainability
* Preference for human-readable formats
* Separation of form and content
* Support for academic apparatuses
* Platform independence

## Subsection 1.2: Creation of Markdown Text

Then came the actual creation of Markdown text in Atom and using the Terminal to install additional programs. Writing out content in Markdown was relatively straightforward and simple for me. With a strong background in visual/graphic design, a solid background in HTML, and a little experience with CSS, I felt comfortable adapting to the different rules of Markdown.

Then, came converting the files.

# Section 2: Converting Markdown

## Subsection 2.1: Converting into MS Word Documents and HTML

Following the directions to install Pandoc went smoothly enough. Accessing the directory in my computer through the terminal to convert my main.md file into a MS Word document and HTML file was simple, too.

At some point in this process, I changed the name of the directory from "Digital Humanities" to "DigitalHumanities" but did not see that it had affected the path of my main.md file.

I decided to give a go at converting my Markdown into a formatted PDF file.

## Subsection 2.2: Converting into PDF

I started off by trying to install LaTeX on terminal. I installed LaTeX, but when I tried to run the command "$ pandoc main.md -o main.pdf".

I pair programmed[^1] on next steps. We ran into some issues because we needed administrative access. We used "sudo" to get my administrative access in the terminal. Having done that, we kept getting the error "! LaTeX Error: File "arial.sty" not found."  

We kept altering the main.md file, thinking that perhaps by changing the parameters in it for font would allow it to convert properly. We found various suggestions on Stack Exchange and various blogs. Eventually, I realized that the path listed on the Atom file was different than the path I was connected to in the terminal. We resaved the file in the proper file directory, ran the script again, and viola, a PDF was created/converted.

# Section 3: Debrief

## Subsection 3.1: Lessons Learned

So what'd I learn? A few things. I learned about the existence and complexity and history behind LaTeX. I relearned how to search and navigate to files and directories in the terminal. I relearned how to troubleshoot search in Google for errors and how others approached them. I relearned how to go back to the beginning, retrace my steps, and look for minute details.

## Subsection 3.2: Markdown as a Tool for Digital Humanities Practitioners

I do think that after some upfront work and learning, this tool could be useful to a digital humanities practitioner when submitting and uploading work to various mediums and platforms. That initial learning curve could be too much for some, though, in the event of tight deadlines or the volume of existing text/work.

Overall, though, it is a very fun learning and troubleshooting exercise. I see it acting as a wonderful introduction to a budding digital humanities practitioner or front-end web designer when trying to learn how to use the terminal and understand the semantics that lead to HTML.
